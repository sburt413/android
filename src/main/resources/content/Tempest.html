<b>PROSPERO</b><br/>
<i>Of the king's ship</i><br/>
The mariners say how thou hast disposed<br/>
And all the rest o' the fleet.<br/>

<b>ARIEL</b>
<i>Safely in harbour</i><br/>
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once<br/>
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew<br/>
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:<br/>
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;<br/>
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,<br/>
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet<br/>
Which I dispersed, they all have met again<br/>
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,<br/>
Bound sadly home for Naples,<br/>
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd<br/>
And his great person perish.<br/>
